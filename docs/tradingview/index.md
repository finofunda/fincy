TradingView offers wide-range of functionalities like back-testing, custom indicators etc. which are written in Pine Script.
In addition, the scripts documentation page can be used to showcase on how to use the code, getting started and other
technical aspects. Below are the links to my scripts, their documentations and release notes.

This section of `fincy` provides additional notes, statistical concepts, and other linguo that might be helpful for the
Pine Script. Please check the table of contents for more information.

## Getting Started

The indicators, strategies etc. are published in TradingView. To add the custom indicator or strategies use the indicators
dropdown to add them to your chart. Unpublished scripts can be directly added/edited from the PineScript editor as follows:'

  1. Click on "Pine Editor" at the bottom/right panel of the chart,
  2. For indicator - directly paste the code and click on "Add to Chart", and for strategies, click "Create New > Strategy"
    and then past the code and click on "Add to Chart".
  3. You can also save the indicator (optional) to your own library.

For more information check [custom indicator](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/custom_studies/)
documentation.

### TradingView Indicators

An indicator is a function built on the basis of trading statistics (such as opening, closing, minimum or maximum price,
trading volumes, etc.). Analyzing changes in such values allows predicting the future movement of the market. The values of the
indicators are displayed on the chart as lines, columns, points, geometric figures, and other visual elements.

### TradingView Strategies

A strategy is a Pine Script code - a very powerful script that can perform - (i) backtesting of a concept on the historical
data and (ii) can send/execute buy/sell orders for an instrument.
