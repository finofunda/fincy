TradingView offers wide-range of functionalities like back-testing, custom indicators etc. which are written in Pine Script.
This directory lists all the indicators, strategies etc. which are either already published or scripted for general users.

The pine scripts are defined with a `.pine` extension, and as on 29.01.2026 the scripts are v6 compatible, which is the latest
version. Check [PineScript Documentation](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/welcome/) for more information.

We're moving all the documents under [Project FinCY Documentation](https://fincy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tradingview/index.html).
Equivalent Python codes, implementations and usages are discussed in the documentation.
